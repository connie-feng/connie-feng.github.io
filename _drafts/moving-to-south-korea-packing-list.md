This packing list has more winter clothes because I will be arriving in Korea in January. :snowflake:

I am trying very hard to not pack too much clothes! That was the biggest mistake I made when packing for study abroad in Korea. The sizing in Korea works for me, so I can buy more clothes there if needed. These are the questions I am asking myself to try and narrow down my list:
1. Do I feel comfortable and confident in these clothes?
1. Do these clothes air dry easily? (Most homes will have a washer but no dryer.)

I was also able to remove things from my packing list by checking if Gmarket or Coupang (kind of like the Amazon of Korea) sell them for an acceptable price.

#### Travel Essentials
* passport + visa + photocopies
* Fulbright paperwork
* wallet + emergency cash
* inflatable travel pillow
* masks :mask:
* disinfecting wipes
* jet lag prevention pills
* eye mask
* ear plugs
* T-money cards (Korean transportation card)

#### Quarantine/PPE Supplies
As soon as I arrive in Korea, I have to do a mandatory 2 week quarantine at a facility. I am bringing some extra supplies for that.
* alcohol wipes
* face shields
* sleeping bag liner - I will feel more at ease if I don't sleep directly on sheets that other people used at the quarantine facility. I also think this will be useful when I travel!

#### Teacher Clothes
Fulbright asks us to bring business casual clothes for teaching and for Fulbright activities. I've read that a lot of schools have a more casual dress code, but I would rather be a little overdressed than a little underdressed. :smile:
