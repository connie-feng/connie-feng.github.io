### Sizing + Cost
* MINI
* Soft cup - doesn’t really press on your bladder, can’t really feel it
* Cost: cup ($6) + shipping ($4) = $10

### Routine
* On regular days, I change the cup every 12 hours - once in the morning, once at night (more often in the first 24 hours)
* Feels very clean if you take it out, clean it, and put it back in while in the shower
* Exercise everyday - totally fine!
    * Yoga
    * Upside down
    * Squats
* Cup + liner OR cup + Thinx period underwear for extra security

### Putting it in
* Try different folds and positions (see table below)
* If it hurts, you’re probably trying to push it in at the wrong angle
* I have to wiggle it back and forth or side to side while pushing it in
* Kinda sticks out but then shifts into place
* To check if it sealed, pull on the end - at first I thought it was slipping out, but it’s just the nub stretching
* I have a hard time getting it to pop open, so I just stick it in and then go about my business, and it shifts into place/pops open by itself

### Taking it out
* Pinch the base and pull out (if the cup is very full, pinching the base too much might cause some blood to overflow)
* If you can’t reach the base, push like you’re pooping and it’ll push the cup down so you can reach
* Taking it out feels weird (since the cup mostly open), but I guess I'll get used to it?

### Tips
* Cut your fingernails!!!!

### My first attempts at putting in the cup

| Attempt |  Position | Fold | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | standing with a leg propped up | punch down | couldn't get it in |
| 2 | sitting on the toilet with a foot propped up | punch down | got it mostly in, but couldn't get it to pop open |
| 3 | squatting | half diamond | couldn't get it in |

*The next day...*

| Attempt | Position | Fold | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4 | sitting on the toilet with a foot propped up | punch down | got it in all the way (and didn't feel it!), but couldn't get it to pop open |

I should probably cut my nails. I'll try again next cycle.

*The next cycle...*

| Attempt | Position | Fold | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 5 | sitting on the toilet with a foot propped up | c fold | couldn't get it in |
| 6 | sitting on the toilet with a foot propped up | punch down | got it in, couldn't get it to open |

I ended up just leaving the cup in, and it eventually opened and sealed by itself.

After a couple of days of the sitting on the toilet + punch down combo, I was able to get it in while standing in the shower with a leg propped up, but it was much more difficult for me than while sitting on the toilet.

All in all, this was probably the best period I've ever had. It almost felt like I was not on my period! I felt super clean, and no dried blood smell!!
