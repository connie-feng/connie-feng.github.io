SO TIRING, BUT SO WORTH IT! Joe Hisaishi was so SMOL AND ADORABLE! I loved watching him conduct, especially when a smile burst from his face. Sometimes it looked like he was dancing. And I loved how he switched between conducting and playing the piano. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING SUCH BEAUTIFUL MUSIC INTO THE WORLD. <3

I did hear him mess up on the piano twice, which was kind of jarring. But it also made me think, *"ah, even masters can make mistakes"*. (:

I was so nervous/excited while we were waiting to meet him in the VIP Lounge after the concert! My legs would not stop shaking!

We only got like 15 seconds with him because they were rushing groups through and we could only take a picture. We walked up to him and he had his arms wide open so I went in for an awkward hug HAHA I hope he was okay with that! (I still cringe when I think back to how awkward it was, even though I'm sure he doesn't remember xD). I think Caroline hugged him too after! Then we took the pic and Caroline told him she cried the whole time and I told him it was so beautiful and I forgot to ask him to come perform in Texas next time… xD And then we shook hands again and I think he said thank you and then we were off. It was such a blur!

And I still don’t know if he really speaks English! He didn’t speak to the audience during the concert and when we met him I only recall him saying ‘Thank you’. xD

I've listened to this concert on YouTube so many times, so being able to go in real life was a dream come true!
