#### Compiled vs. Interpreted Language
* compiled language - can optimize, makes the code more efficient
* interpreted - has to go line by line

#### Stack vs. Heap Allocation
* heap used when amount of memory required is not known in advance
* known by the compiler at compile time typically goes on the stack; dynamically allocated at runtime - on the heapâ€¨

#### Array vs. Linked List
* arrays are good for random access
* linked lists are good for adding or removing items (array has to resize and copy over), or when you're not sure how many items will be in the list

#### TODO
* DFS vs. BFS
* abstract vs. interface
* dynamic programming
* [longest palindrome](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_9kU6XL8njr_1.py)
* [pascal's triangle](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_RUTIiY3yBb_1.py)
* [fibonacci](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_5HpDWjI6xF_1.py)
* [roman numerals](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user305_bZoAtXI4Pd_0.py)
* much much more
