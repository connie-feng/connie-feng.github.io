teaser: Advice given to me from interviewers when I was about to graduate from college.
---

* take time off to travel
* college is for learning how to learn
* you learn from mistakes too
* if you get something working, just put it out - it'll get you a lot further than not releasing it until it is "perfect"
* in school the most thorough person gets the best grade, but in real life, agility and "good enough" is what works
* be open to new things, don't think of yourself as just a "java developer"; you're hired to solve problems and find solutions
* don't be afraid to do stuff that wasn't asked of you
