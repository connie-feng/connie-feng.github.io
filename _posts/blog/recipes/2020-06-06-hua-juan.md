### Ingredients
#### Dough
* 1 cup milk (or water)
* 2 teaspoons instant yeast
* 2 2/3 to 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

#### Filling
* 1-2 green onions, minced (depends on how green onion-y you want it!)
* a pinch of baking soda (optional, helps the green onion stay green through steaming)
* 1/2 teaspoon canola/vegetable/olive oil
* a pinch of salt
* black pepper to taste (white pepper also works)
* a few drops Sichuan pepper oil （花椒油）(optional, makes the hua juan more fragrant)

### Directions
1. Add yeast to room temperature/lukewarm milk and let sit for 10 minutes.
2. Add flour, mix with chopsticks, and knead into a dough. The dough should be on the firmer side.
3. Cover and let the dough rise until roughly double in size. This took about 30 minutes at 80 degrees F.
4. Deflate the dough, and knead for a couple of minutes. The dough will feel softer now.
5. Cover and let the dough rise until double in size again. This took another 30 minutes.
6. Make the filling while waiting for the dough to rise. Mix all the filling ingredients together.
7. Deflate and knead the dough. Separate the dough in half, and keep the other half covered.
8. See video for how to shape the hua juan.
9. After shaping, rest the dough for ~10 minutes.
10. Steam for 20 minutes.
