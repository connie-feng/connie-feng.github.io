### Ingredients

* 1/2 lb any cheap cut of beef or pork (we're using beef shoulder)
* 3 dried chili peppers
* 1 teaspoon whole Sichuan peppercorn
* 2 teaspoons oil
* 1 teaspoon soy sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar (or to taste)
* toasted sesame seeds (optional garnish)

### Preparing the Meat
1. Slice into thin strips, against the grain (so it's easier to chew).
1. Put beef in a dry nonstick pan. Cook over medium heat until the meat releases all its water, and throw away the scummy water.

### Directions
1. Put meat, dried chilis, Sichuan peppercorn, and oil in a dry nonstick pan. Stir fry over medium heat until it becomes fragrant, around 1-2 minutes.
1. Add soy sauce. Stir fry until all liquid has evaporated, around 1-2 minutes.
1. Turn off the heat. Sprinkle sugar over and serve immediately. Alternatively, sprinkle sugar over after putting the meat in the serving platter.
1. Garnish with sesame seeds if you want to.
1. Enjoy!

Note: You can make this in a big batch. 1/2 lb was definitely not enough, we devoured it I could've eaten all of it as a snack. xD
