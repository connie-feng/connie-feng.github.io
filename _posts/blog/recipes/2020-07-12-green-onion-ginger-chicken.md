### Ingredients

* a nice whole chicken (get a free range or organic chicken)
* golf-ball sized ginger, minced
* 2 green onions, minced
* salt to taste

### Directions
1. Combine ginger, green onion, and 1 tablespoon of salt. Split the mixture in 2 - for the marinade and for the dipping sauce.
2. Rub the marinade all over the chicken and refrigerate over night.
3. Cover and boil the chicken in barely simmering water for 20 minutes, then remove from heat and keep covered for 15 minutes.
4. Remove the chicken from the broth and cool (preferably in ice water).
5. Filter the broth through a sieve and use it for noodles or soup! Put one ladle of the broth into the other half of the mixture in step #1 for a dipping sauce.
6. Enjoy!
