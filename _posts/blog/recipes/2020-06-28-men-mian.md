### Ingredients
* 4 servings noodles (ones that don't stick together)
* 2 cups green beans or long beans
* 4 tablespoons oil
* pinch salt
* 1/2 teaspoon dark soy sauce (optional - for color)
* 2 cups broth or water (more if using fresh noodles - they absorb more liquid)

#### Meat
* 1/2 lb pork belly, sliced
* 4 slices ginger
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon shaoxing cooking wine

### Directions
#### Prep Work
1. Marinate pork belly in ginger, soy sauce, and shaoxing cooking wine for 30 minutes to overnight.
2. Cook noodles halfway in boiling water (skip if using fresh noodles).

#### Cooking
1. In a nonstick pan, add oil and marinated pork belly. Stir fry for 1 minute.
2. Add beans, salt, and dark soy sauce. Stir fry for 1 minute.
3. Add the half cooked dried noodles (or fresh noodles).
4. Add broth/water. Cover and steam for 10 minutes over medium heat.
5. Check on the noodles. If there is still water, cover and steam for another 5 minutes.
6. Once the liquid has evaporated, turn of the heat and stir.
7. Enjoy! I like to eat it with lao gan ma spicy chili crisp.
