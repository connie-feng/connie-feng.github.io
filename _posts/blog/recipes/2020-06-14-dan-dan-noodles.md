* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 1/2 - 1 teaspoon Sichuan pepper oil （花椒油）
* 1 tablespoon lao gan ma spicy chili crisp
* 1 teaspoon lao gan ma chili oil with black bean
* 4 teaspoons chicken broth

2. Boil the noodles until al dente. When the noodles are almost done, add leafy greens.
3. Mix all the sauce ingredients in a bowl.
4. Add cooked noodles to the sauce bowl and mix.
5. Top with ground pork and green onion.
6. Mix and enjoy!
