### Ingredients
* 3-4 lbs St. Louis ribs or baby back ribs

##### Dry Rub
* 5 teaspoons brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon chili powder

##### Marinade
* 3 teaspoons soy sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon dark soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon honey
* 1 teaspoon black vinegar
* 1 teaspoon shoaxing cooking wine
* 3 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 ping-pong sized ginger, sliced

### Directions

1. Line a baking pan with foil and put ribs on the foil.
1. Mix ingredients for the dry rub.
1. Pat all over the ribs.
1. Cover with foil and refrigerate over night.

***The next morning…***

1. Put ginger pieces underneath the ribs to elevate it.
1. Mix all ingredients for the marinade  except the ginger.
1. Pour over the top of the ribs.
1. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Make sure to seal the foil tightly so that no air will be able to escape when it’s cooking later. We’re having it for dinner, so we’re letting it marinate for about 8 hours.

***That evening...***

1. Put the ribs in the oven at 330-350 degrees F for 1 hour. We put ours on the bottom rack of the oven. You can also put the foil package on the grill instead!
1. Flip the ribs and tightly cover. Put back in the oven for another 30 minutes. It's ready once all the liquid has evaporated.
1. Cut and enjoy!
