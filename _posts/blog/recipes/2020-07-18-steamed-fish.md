### Ingredients

* a 1.5 lb fresh whole fish (tilapia)
* ping-pong size ginger, cut into small matchsticks
* salt to taste
* 1 tablespoon shaoxing cooking wine
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* a splash of black vinegar
* 2-3 tablespoons oil
* cilantro
* green onion

### Obtaining the Fish
Go to a grocery store with live fish. Get a fish that is about 1.5 lbs. Ask the fishmonger to remove the innards/scales/fins, and to leave the head on (these services are free).

### Directions
1. Wash the fish. Score on both sides so the seasoning can get in.
1. Put ginger and salt on the inside and outside.
1. Pour shaoxing cooking wine, soy sauce, and black vinegar over the fish. Leave to marinate for 30 minutes.
1. Cover and steam the fish for 7 minutes.
1. While the fish is steaming, heat up the oil until smoking.
1. Remove the fish from heat and garnish with cilantro and green onion.
1. Ladle 2-3 tablespoons of the hot oil onto the fish. It should sizzle!
1. Enjoy!


Note: You need to finish the whole fish in one sitting - it won't be good as leftovers.
