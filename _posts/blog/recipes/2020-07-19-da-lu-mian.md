### Ingredients

* noodles
* 4 dried shiitake mushrooms
* a handful of dried lily flower
* a handful of black fungus (aka wood ear mushrooms)
* 1/2 lb pork shoulder or belly, thinly sliced
* 3 slices of ginger
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 star anise
* 2 eggs
* 1 tablespoon corn starch
* water

### Soak Dried Ingredients
1. Soak dried lily flower in water for 3-4 hours. Change the water every 30 minutes.
1. Soak wood ear mushrooms in water for 1 hour.
1. Rinse shiitake mushrooms, then soak in water for 1 hour. This water will be used in the noodle sauce.

### Prep Ingredients
1. Slice shiitake mushrooms.
1. Rinse wood ear mushrooms one by one to get rid of sand/dirt, and rip into smaller pieces.
1. Wring out the extra water from the lily flowers.

### Cooking
1. Put pork, ginger, shiitake mushrooms, shiitake mushroom water, wood ear mushrooms, lily flowers, soy sauce, salt, and star anise into a pot.
1. Stir all the ingredients, making sure to untangle the lily flowers.
1. Add enough water to cover all of the ingredients, and then some more.
1. Cook for 20 minutes in a pressure cooker (we used the congee setting), or over the stove for 1 hour.

### Serving
1. Cook noodles.
1. Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk.
1. Whisk corn starch into some water.
1. Pour the corn starch water into the pot and mix. Bring back up to a boil.
1. Pour the eggs in the pot and slowly mix.
1. Spoon the sauce over the noodles and enjoy!

Note: The sauce keeps well in the refrigerator, so you can make a big batch!
