### Ingredients
* 2 pork trotters
* 1 knob of ginger
* chopped green onions (garnish)

### Braising Ingredients
* 3 tbs soy sauce
* 1 tbs dark soy sauce
* 1 tbs cooking wine (to remove the pork smell)
* 1/2 tbs black vinegar (to remove the pork smell)
* 1 star anise (to remove the pork smell)
* 1 piece of rock sugar (or granulated sugar)
* 1/2 tsp salt

### Equipment
* pressure cooker or instant pot

### Directions
#### Prep Work
0. Depending on your pork trotters, you may or may not need to shave the hair off with a clean razor.
1. Boil the pork trotters in water to get rid of scum.
2. Wash the pork trotters with clean water.
3. Put the pork trotters and ginger in the pressure cooker. Cover with clean water.
4. Cook on the meat setting, or until tender. (If you don't have a pressure cooker, you can boil the pork trotters until tender in a normal pot, but that will take a long time.)
5. Side note: At this point, the pork trotters already taste super good if you put some chili oil on them, or dip them in soy sauce mixed with jalapeños! Continue with the recipe if you want the red braised part. :)

#### Cooking
1. In a pan, add all the braising ingredients.
2. Put the cooked pork trotters in the pan, skin side down so they can soak in the sauce.
3. Cover and cook on medium heat. Once the sauce boils for a few minutes, flip the pork trotters.
4. Cover and continue cooking until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes.
5. Give everything a final stir. Turn off the stove and garnish.
6. Enjoy! Get that collagen!
7. If you have leftovers, you can refrigerate them. The pork trotters taste delicious cold too!
