### Ingredients
* 1/2 lb ground pork
* 3 small potatoes
* salt
* pepper
* garlic powder
* turmeric 
* 1 tbsp olive oil (if ground pork is lean)
* minced ginger
* chopped green onions

### Directions
#### Prep Work
1. Boil the potatoes and mash them. The ratio of mashed potatoes to meat should be around 1:1.
2. Mix the ground pork with olive oil, ginger, and green onions.
3. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly. 
4. Shape into ping pong ball-sized meatballs. When shaping, throw the meatballs into your palm with force to get rid of air bubbles. You can put oil on your hands to prevent sticking.
5. If using lean ground pork, you can spray the surface with extra oil so the outside gets crispier.

#### Cooking
1. In the air fryer, bake at 400 F for 8 minutes.
2. Flip the meatballs, and bake for another 5 minutes.
3. Enjoy!
