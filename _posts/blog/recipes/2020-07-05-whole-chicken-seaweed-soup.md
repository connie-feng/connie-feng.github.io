### Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken, 3 lbs
* ping-pong size ginger, sliced
* 75 grams dried seaweed (prophase kelp slices)
* 1 tablespoon shaoxing cooking wine
* salt to taste

#### Dipping Sauce
Pick your ratio! I used:
* 1 green onion, minced
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* [homemade hot chili oil]({% post_url blog/recipes/2020-04-01-hot-chili-oil %})
* a few drops Sichuan pepper oil （花椒油）
* 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil

### Directions

#### Prepare Seaweed
1. Soak dried seaweed in water overnight.
2. Wash the seaweed.
3. Roll the seaweed up and cut into thin slices.
4. Soak in water until ready to cook.

#### Prepare Chicken
1. Wash chicken and trim off excess fat and tail bone.
2. Boil the chicken for a few minutes to get rid of scum. We want a clean and clear broth!

#### Cooking
1. Place the chicken and ginger slices in a clean pot. Add enough water to cover the chicken.
2. Add shaoxing cooking wine and salt to taste (you can always add more salt at the end if necessary).
3. Bring to a boil, then simmer for about 2 hours. Skim off oil and scum as necessary.
4. Add the seaweed during the last 30 minutes of cooking.
5. Mix up the dipping sauce while waiting for the chicken to cook!

#### Eating
The chicken and seaweed are very lightly seasoned, so enjoy it with the spicy dipping sauce! I also love putting rice in the soup.
