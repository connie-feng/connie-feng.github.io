This packing list has more winter clothes because I will be arriving in Korea in January. :snowflake:

I am trying very hard to not pack too much clothes! That was the biggest mistake I made when packing for study abroad in Korea. The sizing in Korea sometimes works for me, so I can buy more clothes there if needed. These are the questions I am asking myself to try and narrow down my list:
1. Do I feel comfortable and confident in these clothes?
1. Do these clothes air dry easily? (Most homes will have a washer but no dryer.)

I was also able to remove things from my packing list by checking if Gmarket or Coupang (kind of like the Amazon of Korea) sell them for an acceptable price.

**I will come back and edit this with things I didn't need to bring and things I wish I had brought!**
