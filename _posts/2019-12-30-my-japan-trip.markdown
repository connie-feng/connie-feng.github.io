| Place | Go? | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Mega Don Quijote - Shibuya | n | Too crowded. You can find Kit Kats at other Don Quijotes, and other things for cheaper at the grocery store. Might be a good option if you only have a few days in Tokyo. |
| Imperial Palace | y | A very nice walk around the perimeter! |
| JINS flagship - Shibuya | y | Awesome place if you need new prescription glasses! |
| Kisoji Shinjuku - sukiyaki | y | Get the **marbled** beef sukiyaki that you cook on the table, not the premade ones! I think our course was around 4000 JPY per person. So worth it! Kisoji is a chain with several locations around Tokyo. |
| Roppongi Hills | n | It's a mall. |
| Ghibli Museum | y | It's cheapest to get your tickets ahead of time (the month before your visit) from Lawsons. Check the website and Google for instructions. |
| Yoshinoya | y | A chain with cheap beef bowls! |
| Flippers | y | Chain with the best souffle pancakes! |
| Kichijoji shopping street | y | Nice neighborhood with cute stores |
| Yoyogi Park | y | Great for people watching |
| Ebisu | n | A neighborhood that was supposed to be comparable to Kichijoji, but we weren't impressed |
| Tokyo DisneySea | y | Go on a weekday! Use the free FastPass system. Don't miss the Arabian Coast, Japan-only snacks, the bakery, Sindbad's Storybook Voyage, Big Band Beat, and Song of the Mirage. Go to big Litteria for the lottery to get reserved seats in the shows (only one try at the lottery per show). Don't worry if you don't get tickets in the lottery - if you want to see the show, line up early to try to get into the non-reserved section! Skip Aladdin, Nemo, 20k Leagues Under the Sea. |
| Jiyugaoka | y | Cute neighborhood if you're in the area! Try a creme brulee crepe at Comcrepe! |
| Teamlab borderless museum | y | Go on a weekday and buy tickets beforehand online! We went on a Tuesday afternoon around 3:30 PM and the crowd wasn't too bad. We only had to wait 5 minutes for the floating lanterns room, which I think is one of the most popular rooms. |
| Ameno Yokocho | y | Tourist spot with lots of shops. The place with the cheapest kaisendons (sashimi on top of rice)!  Go here instead of Tsukiji. Also found cheaper drugstore items here as well, like pain relief patches, gentle steam eye masks, and the specific lip balm I was looking for. |
| Ueno Park | y | The area around the lake is beautiful! |
| Tsukiji Outer Market | n | Super crowded and I had the worst uni here. Expensive tourist trap. |
