teaser: I always forget things that will make me feel better when I'm in the moment. So here is a list that I will hopefully refer to when I'm feeling down, anxious, worried, nervous, angry, embarrassed, etc. And I aim to continuously grow this list!
---

* Everything goes.

### The Untethered Soul
* You're spinning around on a rock in the middle of space. Does what you're upset about really matter? Will you care about it next week? Next month? Next year? Will it matter when you're dead?
* Nothing is worth closing your heart over.
* You are not your thoughts.
* You are not your emotions.
* You can decide to be happy.

### Stress + Worry
* Don't worry about stuff you can't control.
* Think about your worst week of sophomore year... If you can survive that week, you can survive anything!
* Everything seems like the end of the world when you're going through it.
* “No good sittin' worryin' abou' it. What's comin' will come, an' we'll meet it when it does.” - Hagrid

### Comparisons + Negativity
* Stop comparing your normal to someone else's highlights.
* Everyone has a different journey.
* Don't let someone you don't know/like affect you so negatively.
* If it is something you have to do anyways, try to do your best with a willing heart.

### Money
* You win some, you lose some.

### Embarrassment
* You'll probably be able to laugh about it in the future.

### Discipline
* Cravings and desires are always changing based on your brain and environment. Don't fall for desires that satisfy short-term goals but don't fulfill the long-term goals of your true self. For example, having seconds or that extra dessert will satisfy your short-term cravings, but not your long-term health goals; lashing out when you're feeling angry might make you feel better now, but will make you feel worse later.

### Gratitude
* Think about how adorable your mom is. (TODO: add text photos)
